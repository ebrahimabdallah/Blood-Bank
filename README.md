# Blood Bank Project

## Description

- The Blood Bank Project is a web application that facilitates blood donation and requests. It allows users to donate blood and make requests for blood donation. 
- When I finish studying the fundamentals and basics of Laravel, API, HTML, and CSS, I started working on my project.
## Features

- User Registration and Authentication:
  - Users can register an account and log in to the application.
  - User authentication is implemented to ensure secure access to the system.

- Blood Donation Requests:
  - Users can create blood donation requests, providing information such as blood type and contact details.
  - The application applies conditions to validate and process the donation requests.

- Middleware for Authorization:
  - Middleware is implemented to restrict unauthorized access to certain functionality.
  - Only the user who created a donation request can update or remove it.
  - Middleware ensures that users cannot update or remove requests made by other users.

## Technologies Used

- Laravel: A PHP framework used for building robust web applications.
